Here is a vignette for the Coursera **Building R Packages** Week 4 assignment.

The functions provided in this package load and analyse data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

Use the following functions to analyse data:

-   `fars_summarize_years`: summarises the data for the given years by returning count observations in each year/month category
-   `fars_map_state`: plots accidents for a given state and year on a map
